# Elm327-React-Native
![app_on_android](can_display_irl_1.png)   
Application running on Android device.


\
\
This project is built on the react-native with `Polidea/react-native-ble-plx`.
This was used as an experiment to communicate with an nrf52 chip. But later switched to working with ELM327 BLE dongel.
There is no list device screen so you have to hardcode the device name as it is today.
It will build and it will request the PIDs queued up.

## Getting started developing
1. npm install?.
2. react-native start.
3. react-native run-android.
